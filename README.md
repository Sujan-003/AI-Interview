> **"Like a real interview, but personalised for you."**  
> **Master your technical interviews through realistic, voice-based simulations and intelligent feedback.**

## 🌟 Why Prepzo?

Traditional interview prep like mock quizes fails to capture the pressure and dynamic nature of a real interview.

**Prepzo fills this gap by simulating the entire lifecycle:**

1.  **Requirement Gathering:** Just like a recruiter or an initial screen, we figure out _exactly_ what you need.
2.  **The Interview:** A real-time voice conversation where you speak, and the AI listens, questions, and follows up.
3.  **The Feedback:** Detailed, constructive criticism to help you improve.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🗣️ 1. Pre-Interview Consultation (The "Receptionist")

Before the interview starts, you sit down for a quick voice session with our "Receptionist" agent.

- **Dynamic Requirement Gathering:** Instead of filling out boring forms or parsing a static resume, you simply _tell_ the agent what you want.
  - _"I want to practice for a Senior Frontend role focusing on React and performance."_
  - _"Grill me on system design concepts for a backend role."_
- **Personalised Experience:** The agent understands your specific goals—whether you're a fresher looking for a general checkup or a senior dev needing to polish specific skills—and tailors the upcoming interview session accordingly.

### 🎙️ 2. The Main Interview (Real-Time Voice)

Once the stage is set, the main interview begins.

- **Powered by ElevenLabs & Vapi:** A high-quality, ultra-low latency voice interaction that feels natural.
- **Adaptive Questioning:** Questions are not pulled randomly from a list. They are generated by **Google Gemini**, specifically curated based on your consultation session.
- **Interactive Flow:** The AI listens to your answers, asks follow-up questions, and digs deeper if your answers are vague—just like a real interviewer.

### 📊 3. Intelligent Feedback Loop

The interview doesn't end when you hang up.

- **Comprehensive Analysis:** The entire transcript is analyzed by **Google Gemini** to evaluate your performance.
- **Structured Scoring:** Get a breakdown of your Technical Skills, Communication, Problem Solving, and Confidence.
- **Actionable Advice:** Receive specific tips on how to improve your answers and clarity.
- **Retake & Improve:** Use the feedback to sharpen your skills and jump back in for another round.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

Prepzo relies on a sophisticated orchestration of AI models and real-time data streams.

```

### Core Components Flow

1.  **The Client**: Your browser handles the UI and establishes a secure WebSocket connection to Vapi.
2.  **Voice Layer**: Vapi acts as the conductor. It sends your speech to **Deepgram** for instant transcription and routes the text to **Gemini**.
3.  **The Brain (Gemini)**:
    - In **Consultation Mode**, it acts as a listener, extracting your requirements to build a JSON profile.
    - In **Interview Mode**, it acts as the interviewer, generating relevant questions and improvising based on your answers.
4.  **The Response**: Gemini's text response is sent to **ElevenLabs**, which converts it into high-quality human speech and streams it back to you—all in milliseconds.
5.  **Feedback**: Once the session ends, Gemini analyzes the full transcript stored in **Firestore** to generate your performance report.
